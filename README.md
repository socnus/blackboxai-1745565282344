# Task Management System

## Project Overview
The Task Management System is a PHP-based web application designed to help users manage tasks efficiently. It includes features for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks, as well as a robust filtering system based on task status, priority, and category. The application implements user authentication and authorization, granting access depending on user roles (admin or regular user).

## Installation
To set up the Task Management System, please follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd task-management-system
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Ensure that you have a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) and PHP installed.
   - Create a MySQL database for the application.
   - Import the database schema from the provided SQL files (if any, not included in the source here).

3. **Configure Database Credentials**:
   - Update the database connection settings in the `includes/init.php` file.

4. **Install Composer Dependencies** (if applicable):
   If the project uses third-party PHP libraries managed by Composer, run:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   Access the application via your web browser at `http://localhost/task-management-system`.

## Usage
Once the application is running, users can perform the following actions:

- **Login/Logout**: Only logged-in users can access the task management features.
- **View Tasks**: Users can view the list of tasks, which are paginated and filterable.
- **Add New Task**: Admin users can create new tasks, assign them to users, and specify priority and due dates.
- **Edit Task**: Admin users can modify existing tasks' details.
- **View Task Details**: Users can click on a task to view detailed information, including comments and assignments.
- **Update Task Status**: Users can update the status of tasks (e.g., from "In Progress" to "Completed").

## Features
- User authentication and role-based access control.
- Task creation, modification, viewing, and deletion.
- Task filtering by status, priority, and category.
